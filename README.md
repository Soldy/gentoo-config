# About this

This is my personal Gentoo install helper. 
This collection can be a bit difficult, but it can assist in completing a Gentoo installation in less than 4 hours. However, it's important to note that this is not an automated installer, so you need to be familiar with all the installation steps for Gentoo. Tasks such as partitioning, keymap setup, xorg/wayland setup, and network setup are not covered. Make sure to know the [installation steps](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Full/Installation) before attempting to use this.
